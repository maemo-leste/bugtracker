Maemo Leste
===========

This bugtracker of this repository contains tasks that we want to pick and
issues that we want to solve.

[![issues over time](http://parazyd.enemy.org/issues.png)]

Goals
-----

* Modern maemo-based OS for phones and tablets
* Provide some backwards compatibility with maemo fremantle
* Use open source components where possible, but fall back to closed components
  temporarily while we bring up the OS
* Limit supported devices to a few specific ones in order to avoid spending a
  lot of time on hardware enablement / bringup
* Replacing upstream-dead projects at some point is a good thing
